<img src="https://developer.nexmo.com/assets/images/Vonage_Nexmo.svg" height="48px" alt="Nexmo is now known as Vonage" />

This is a Swift project that uses [Vapor](vapor.codes) to create a HTTP server for the [Vonage Verify API](https://developer.nexmo.com/verify/overview). This allows you to add Two-Factor Authentication to your projects. This blog shows the project in use with an iOS application to allow you to test the server.

## Welcome to Vonage

## Running the project

After cloning the project to your machine, open it in Xcode. Build and run (CMD + R) and the server will be accessible on port 8080.
